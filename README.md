# Predicting Car Mileage with Linear Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a supervised linear regression model to predict car mileage (MPG) based on various features and attributes. The dataset includes historical data about different cars, encompassing factors such as engine size, horsepower, weight, and other relevant specifications.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](http://courses.washington.edu/hcde511/s14/datasets/cars.xls).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Datasets:** Folder containing the dataset used in the project.
- **Images:** Folder for storing visualizations generated during data analysis.

## Project Steps

### 1. Dataset Overview

- Load and explore the dataset.
- Understand the structure and features.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Type casting and data cleaning.

### 3. Univariate Analysis

- Non-graphical and graphical exploration of individual variables.

### 4. Bivariate Analysis

- Correlation matrices and pair plots to analyze relationships.

### 5. Feature Selection

- One-hot encoding of categorical variables.
- Identify feature variables for modeling.

### 6. Model Training and Testing

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train a linear regression model.

### 7. Model Evaluation

- Analyze coefficients and make predictions on the test set.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like MAE and RMSE.

### 8. Residual Analysis

- Examine residuals to ensure the model's assumptions are met.

## Results

The linear regression model demonstrated its ability to predict car mileage based on the selected features. Further optimizations can enhance the model's performance.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive overview of the process of developing a linear regression model for predicting car mileage. Thorough data exploration, preprocessing, and model training were conducted to gain valuable insights into the dataset.
